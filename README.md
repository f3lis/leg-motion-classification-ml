# Machine learning approaches to leg motion classification and feature optimization analysis
MATLAB leg motion classification on accelerometer data using a deep convolutional neural network and a Gauss Naive Bayes classifier with a peak location optimization done via numerical methods. The full writeup for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/f3lis/leg-motion-classification-ml/blob/main/LegMotionClassificationML.pdf).
