# Deep CNN
Here, we defined the input as 500 0.01(s) samples of acceleration data, where there are 3 channels for x, y, and z. The network was designed to have two layers of convolutions with max pooling, and two fully connected layers. The two layers of convolutions identify features, with max pooling, reducing, overfitting, and dimensionality. The fully connected layers then identify which features would best serve as classifications to make an accurate model. To develop this model, we had to adjust the hyperparameters listed across the bottom of the network architecture to find the most accurate model. Using this model, the total number of parameters we had to train was 6833, which is relatively small for a deep network thus making it have a relatively low time and space complexity. When training the model on the raw data with a 20% holdout we were able to achieve an average test accuracy of 90.06%, a precedingly high accuracy. Then to further improve the accuracy of the model, we trained the model with feature enhancements on the raw data, using convolutions with Gaussian, Sobel, and Difference of Gaussian filters. Using this method, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 91.46%.
